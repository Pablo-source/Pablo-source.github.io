## Objective {background="#43464B"}

This is a tutorial about creating your personal website using Quarto in RStudio (from Posit) and to publish it to GitHub. The website will include a section about R and Python online resources

`Pre-requisites`

-   GitHub Account: You must have a GitHub account or create a new one to host your website.

-   RStudio: We will push all our code to GitHub using Rstudio (you can use its built in terminal to do it so)

-   Git and GitHub: We will use Git integrated within Rstudio to publish the different website files (index.html, about.html, etc) to GitHub. You can also upload files directly to GitHub website repo.

## 01.Create GitHub Account {background="#43464B"}

For this workshop, I am going to use my GitHub account https://github.com/Pablo-tester. My main GitHub account already includes a personal website: https://github.com/Pablo-source/Pablo-source.github.io
