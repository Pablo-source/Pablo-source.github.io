## Distributions

This is a small introduction to distributions and how to fit them to ggplot2 charts. 

- In statistics a **distribution** is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur. It is also a probability distribution.

- We will use A&E Data Downloaded from NHS Digital website, and we will apply a Normal distribution to Type I Attendances metric.

- The reference and example used to create these distribution charts can be found on this website:

## Load required packages

We start by loading required packages for our analysis. We include *echo=TRUE* and *message=TRUE* to display output from rendered r code chuncks. 

```{r Initial environment setup, echo = TRUE, message=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,
                      dpi = 180, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(here)
```
