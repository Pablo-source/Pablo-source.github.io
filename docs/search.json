It is a data frame (or tibble) with rows of features, columns of attributes, and a special geometry column that contains the spatial aspects of the features.\nFor a further explanation about sf objects, please refer to Jesse Sadler website: [sf objects]https://www.jessesadler.com/post/simple-feature-objects/#:~:text=At%20its%20most%20basic%2C%20an,spatial%20aspects%20of%20the%20features.\nThen I load some extra libraries for data wrangling and to create plots\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(here,tidyverse,osmdata,sf,showtext)\n\n\nThe echo: false option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed)."

In OpenStreetMap, each feature is identified by a key, which is then further subdivided into values.\nTo plot roads or highways on the map, we first need to identify how these features are defined in the osmdata package. We can do this by using the available_features() function to select different types of roads or transportation routes defined in the map.\nOnce we have chosen the desired features, we can add them to our map along with other layers to create a comprehensive and informative representation of Valencia.\n\n\nCode\n# Not run as there are more than 250 elements\n# available_features()\n\n\nLooking at the list of available features, I can see that “highway” is one of the keys that I can use to plot transportation routes on my map of Valencia.

All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.\nThe goal of tidyr is to help you create tidy data. Tidy data is data where: 1. Every column is variable. 2. Every row is an observation. 3. Every cell is a single value.\n\nTidyverse main website: https://www.tidyverse.org/\n\nCore Tidyverse packages:\n\nggplot2: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/\ndplyr: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/\ntidyr: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/\nreadr: https://readr.tidyverse.org/\npurrr: https://purrr.tidyverse.org/\ntibble: https://tibble.tidyverse.org/\nstringr: https://stringr.tidyverse.org/\nforcats: https://forcats.tidyverse.org/\n\n\n\nRelated Tidyverse packages\n\ndbplyr\ndbplyr is the database backend for dplyr. It allows you to use remote database tables as if they are in-memory data frames by automatically converting dplyr code into SQL.\n\nDBPLYR https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/\n\nUsing function ‘show_query()’ after a set of DPLYR verbs, allows you to generate the SQL that is sent tot he database when you request the data.\n\n\ntidyselect\nTools like starts_with() or contains() are called selection helpers. These tools inspect the variable names currently available for selection with peek_vars(). The variable names are registered automatically by eval_select() for the duration of the evaluation:\nThese selection helpers match variables according to a given pattern\nstarts_with() : Starts with an exact prefix. ends_with() : Ends with an exact suffix. contains() : Contains a literal string. matches() : Matches a regular expression. num_range() : Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03.\nTidyselect website: https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2022/10/tidyselect-1-2-0/"

Lockdown measures legally came into force for the first time on 26 March 2020.\nFirst nationwide lockdown was legally effective from 1:00pm on 26th March 2020.\nInitially, all “non-essential” high street businesses were closed and people were ordered to stay at home, permitted to leave for essential purposes only, such as buying food or for medical reasons. Starting in May 2020, the laws were slowly relaxed. People were permitted to leave home for outdoor recreation (beyond exercise) from 13 May. On 1 June, the restriction on leaving home was replaced with a requirement to be home overnight, and people were permitted to meet outside in groups of up to six people.\nSecond national lockdown (November 2020)\nOn 5 November 2020, national restrictions were reintroduced in England. During the second national lockdown, non-essential high street businesses were closed, and people were prohibited from meeting those not in their “support bubble” inside. People could leave home to meet one person from outside their support bubble outdoors.\nThird national lockdown (January to March 2021)\nFollowing concerns that the four-tier system was not containing the spread of the Alpha variant, national restrictions were reintroduced for a third time on 6 January 2021.\nThe rules during the third lockdown were more like those in the first lockdown. People were once again told to stay at home. However, people could still form support bubbles (if eligible) and some gatherings were exempted from the gatherings ban (for example, religious services and some small weddings were permitted).\nReference for National lockdown dates: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9068/"

I will choose theme_minimal() as this will provide a lower inks ratio outcome.\nWe apply then theme_minimal() to the existing ggplot chart\n\n\nCode\nBasic_plot_format <- ggplot(data = TypeI_date_format, aes(x = Datef, y = type_1_num)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Type I A&E Attendances in England\",\n       subtitle = \"2010-2023 Period\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Total Attendances\") + \n scale_x_date(date_labels=\"%Y\",date_breaks  =\"1 year\") +\n theme_minimal()\nBasic_plot_format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Finally we apply colour to the line chart\nWe apply inside geom_line() function two parameters colour to add colour to the existing line and also we include size parameter equal to 1 to increase the size of the line used in the chart:\n\n\nCode\nBasic_plot_format <- ggplot(data = TypeI_date_format, aes(x = Datef, y = type_1_num)) +\n  geom_line(color=\"#69b3a2\", size =1) +\n  labs(title = \"Type I A&E Attendances in England\",\n       subtitle = \"2010-2023 Period\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Total Attendances\") + \n scale_x_date(date_labels=\"%Y\",date_breaks  =\"1 year\") +\n theme_minimal()\nBasic_plot_format\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we can save this plot as an initial basic chart\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"plots/01_AE_Attendances_basic_plot.png\", width = 6, height = 4)\n\n\nAnother variation would be to include a line chart geom_line() and a dot chart geom_point() combined\n\n\nCode\nBasic_plot_format <- ggplot(data = TypeI_date_format, aes(x = Datef, y = type_1_num)) +\n  geom_line(color=\"#69b3a2\", size =1) +\n  geom_point(shape=21, color=\"black\", fill=\"#69b3a2\", size=1.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Type I A&E Attendances in England\",\n       subtitle = \"2010-2023 Period\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Total Attendances\") + \n scale_x_date(date_labels=\"%Y\",date_breaks  =\"1 year\") +\n theme_minimal()\nBasic_plot_format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"plots/02_AE_Attendances_line_point_plot.png\", width = 6, height = 4)"

This function is highly versatile as it allows us to include both text and geoms such as lines and arrows.\nWe then only require one extra function geom_segment() also from ggplot2 to draw straight vertical or horizontal reference lines in the chart area.\n\n5.1.1 Adding rectangle annotation\nWe can start by adding a rectangle to the previous chart\n\n\nCode\nBasic_plot_format <- ggplot(data = TypeI_date_format, aes(x = Datef, y = type_1_num)) +\n  geom_line(color=\"#69b3a2\", size =1) +\n  geom_point(shape=21, color=\"black\", fill=\"#69b3a2\", size=1.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Type I A&E Attendances in England\",\n       subtitle = \"2010-2023 Period\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Total Attendances\") + \n scale_x_date(date_labels=\"%Y\",date_breaks  =\"1 year\") +\n theme_minimal() +\n \n    annotate('rect',\n    xmin = as.Date(\"2018-11-01\"), xmax = as.Date(\"2019-11-01\"),\n    ymin = 700000, ymax = 1100000, \n    alpha = 0.5,\n    fill = 'grey40',\n    col = 'black'\n  )\nBasic_plot_format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Adding text annotation\nWe can start by adding a rectangle to the previous chart Adding a text annotation:\nCOVID pandemic\n\nCOVID-19 was confirmed to be present in the UK by the end of January 2020\nA legally-enforced Stay at Home Order, or lockdown, was introduced on 23 March 2021, banning all non-essential travel and contact with other people, and shut schools, businesses, venues and gathering places.\nA third wave of daily infections began in July 2021 due to the arrival and rapid spread of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.[62]\n\nSo we can establish the COVID-19 pandemic period roughly from 01 January 2020 to 01 August 2021\n\n\nCode\nBasic_plot_format <- ggplot(data = TypeI_date_format, aes(x = Datef, y = type_1_num)) +\n  geom_line(color=\"#69b3a2\", size =1) +\n  geom_point(shape=21, color=\"black\", fill=\"#69b3a2\", size=1.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Type I A&E Attendances in England\",\n       subtitle = \"2010-2023 Period\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Total Attendances\") + \n scale_x_date(date_labels=\"%Y\",date_breaks  =\"1 year\") +\n theme_minimal() +\n \n    annotate('rect',xmin = as.Date(\"2020-01-01\"), xmax = as.Date(\"2021-08-01\"),ymin = 500000, ymax = 1100000, \n    alpha = 0.1 , fill = 'blue',col = 'black') +\n    annotate('text',x = as.Date(\"2020-09-01\"),y = 1120000,label = \"COVID-19\")\n  \nBasic_plot_format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Adding arrows to highlight single values\nWe can also add a curved line with an arrow at the end pointing to specific values. We need to include the arrow function to the curve annotation created earlier: arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.4,'cm')))\nNote that the annotate() function is a good alternative that can reduces the code length for simple cases."

Lockdown measures legally came into force for the first time on 26 March 2020.\nFirst nationwide lockdown was legally effective from 1:00pm on 26th March 2020.\nInitially, all “non-essential” high street businesses were closed and people were ordered to stay at home, permitted to leave for essential purposes only, such as buying food or for medical reasons. Starting in May 2020, the laws were slowly relaxed. People were permitted to leave home for outdoor recreation (beyond exercise) from 13 May. On 1 June, the restriction on leaving home was replaced with a requirement to be home overnight, and people were permitted to meet outside in groups of up to six people.\nSecond national lockdown (November 2020)\nOn 5 November 2020, national restrictions were reintroduced in England. During the second national lockdown, non-essential high street businesses were closed, and people were prohibited from meeting those not in their “support bubble” inside. People could leave home to meet one person from outside their support bubble outdoors.\nThird national lockdown (January to March 2021)\nFollowing concerns that the four-tier system was not containing the spread of the Alpha variant, national restrictions were reintroduced for a third time on 6 January 2021.\nThe rules during the third lockdown were more like those in the first lockdown. People were once again told to stay at home. However, people could still form support bubbles (if eligible) and some gatherings were exempted from the gatherings ban (for example, religious services and some small weddings were permitted).\nReference for National lockdown dates: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9068/"

And this can be the building blocks for software applications.\nThis communication enables us to collect data from various sources, such as social network sites, news websites, online marketplaces or international organisations such as the OECD. Providing us access to multiple health and social indicators that we can download and query in an automated way.\nAPIs save time avoiding the physical download of Excel or CSV files facilitating the data wrangling process providing real time data to online apps or dashboards. It can also be consumed by predictive models to provide latest data to time series or clustering models."

It’s important to stay within these limits to avoid getting blocked.\nError Handling: Always handle potential issues like server errors, bad input or network failures. R packages provide tools to check and manage these gracefully."

Uses tokens for secure, delegated access.\nAPI Keys: Simple and easy for internal services but less secure without proper management.\nJWT (JSON Web Tokens): Stateless and efficient for microservices and distributed systems.\nBasic Authentication: Outdated but simple. Best for low-security internal systems.\nBearer Authentication: Token-based, modern, and scalable for web APIs.\nmTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security): High-security method using certificates for mutual verification.\nOpenID Connect: Built on OAuth 2.0, adds identity verification for managing user identities."
