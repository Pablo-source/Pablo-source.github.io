We specify the feature we want to plot and within that feature, we can also include a set of tags to be plotted in the map. As in the example below, we might want to plot “highway” feature in the map, so we include it in the Overpass query, but also we can specify other tags within that feature such as ““motorway”,“primary”,“secondary”,“tertiary”,“residential”,“living_street”,“unclassified” as we can see in the Valencia city map example.\nosmdata_sf(): Return an OSM Overpass query as an osmdata object in sf format.\n\nThese three functions combined provides me with a gggplot2() object I can turn into a map using geom_sf() to handle shape files and polygons.\nIn a nutshell, a sf object is a collection of simple features that includes attributes and geometries in the form of a data frame. It is a data frame (or tibble) with rows of features, columns of attributes, and a special geometry column that contains the spatial aspects of the features.\nFor a further explanation about sf objects, please refer to Jesse Sadler website: [sf objects]https://www.jessesadler.com/post/simple-feature-objects/#:~:text=At%20its%20most%20basic%2C%20an,spatial%20aspects%20of%20the%20features.\nThen I load some extra libraries for data wrangling and to create plots\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(here,tidyverse,osmdata,sf,showtext)\n\n\nThe echo: false option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed)."

In OpenStreetMap, each feature is identified by a key, which is then further subdivided into values.\nTo plot roads or highways on the map, we first need to identify how these features are defined in the osmdata package. We can do this by using the available_features() function to select different types of roads or transportation routes defined in the map.\nOnce we have chosen the desired features, we can add them to our map along with other layers to create a comprehensive and informative representation of Valencia.\n\n\nCode\n# Not run as there are more than 250 elements\n# available_features()\n\n\nLooking at the list of available features, I can see that “highway” is one of the keys that I can use to plot transportation routes on my map of Valencia.
